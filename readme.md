Our game, FARNAMS FIGHT OFF, is a two-player fighter game based on the beloved
Street Fighter classics, with an innovative twist. You can choose to play
with normal keyboard controls with each player on either side of the keyboard.
OR have one player play with computer vision while the other uses the keyboard.

# PLAYER CONTROLS FOR PAT

W, A, S, D = up, left, down, right
E, R, T = block, punch, kick

# PLAYER CONTROLS FOR MIKE

⬆, ⬅, ⬇, ▶ = up, left, down, right
M, COMMA, PERIOD = block, punch, kick

# PLAYER CONTROLS FOR PAT VISION

JUMP = JUMP
PUNCH = PUNCH
LEAN FORWARD = right
LEAN BACK = left
CROUCH = CROUCH

# INSTALLATION
Make sure your Python has certificates installed, so tensorflow can make an
http request to download the training model.

run **main.py**
run **light.py** if you don't want computer vision

If packages are missing, install them manually:
    pip install pygame
    pip install pygame.locals
    pip install tensorflow
    pip install tensorflow_hub
    pip install numpy
    pip install cv2
    pip install math
