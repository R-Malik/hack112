# FARNAMS FIGHT OFF

**🏆 Carnegie Mellon 15-112 Hackathon 1st Place Winner 🏆**


Our game, FARNAMS FIGHT OFF, is a two-player fighter game based on the beloved
Street Fighter classics, with an innovative twist. You can choose to play
with normal keyboard controls with each player on either side of the keyboard.
OR have one player play with computer vision while the other uses the keyboard.

### 🕹️ Player Controls for Pat

W, A, S, D = up, left, down, right
E, R, T = block, punch, kick

### 🕹️ Player Controls for Mike

⬆, ⬅, ⬇, ▶ = up, left, down, right
M, COMMA, PERIOD = block, punch, kick

### 🎥 Player Controls for Pat (VISION)

Please stand about 3-4 feet away from the webcam on your computer and try to stay to in frame. The following inputs are pretty straightforward:

JUMP = JUMP
PUNCH = PUNCH
LEAN FORWARD = right
LEAN BACK = left
CROUCH = CROUCH

### 💾 Installation

run **light.py** if you don't want computer vision
